The main difference between getElementById() and querySelector() in JavaScript is
 their scope. getElementById() is specifically designed to 
 find an element by its unique ID, while querySelector()
  is more versatile and can select elements using any 
  valid CSS selector, including ID,
 class, tag names, and even attribute selector

 if I want to use the css tags 

 document.querySelector(".highlight"); // gets the first one
document.querySelectorAll(".highlight"); // gets all matching elements
